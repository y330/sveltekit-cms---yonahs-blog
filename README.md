# ENG3U Final Summitive Assignment
###### _Yonah Aviv_

## Assignment overview
This is an open ended creative assignment, and it's purpose is to answer the following question:

> What did I learn in Grade 11 English this Quadmester?



## Description

To answer this question, I coded a website in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) using SvelteKit and tailwind.css(Daisy UI), and wrote a series of blog posts focusing on the reoccuring themes of deception and the destruction of the past in dystopian or corrupted societies. Specifically, the blog posts which were managed in GraphCMS, a content management system, cover the books _1984_ by George Orwell and _The Crucible_ by Arthur Miller, and the short stories "Harrison Bergeron" by Kurt Voggenut Jr. and "The Unknown Citizen" by W.H. Auden. Despite the effort made for all the posts to have a certain depth, the [Harrison Bergeron](https://yonahs-fst.vercel.app/post/harrison-bergeron) one is the most insightful in my opinion.

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

### Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte@next

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

> Note: the `@next` is temporary

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
